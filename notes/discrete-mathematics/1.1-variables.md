#### Example 1.1.1 Writing Sentences Using Variables

Use variables to rewrite the following sentences more formally.

a. Are there numbers with the property that the sum of their squares equals the square of their sum ?

Solution
Are there numbers a and b with the property that $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2?$
Or: Are there numbers a and b such that $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2?$
Or: Do there exist any numbers a and b such that $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2?$

b. Given any real number, its square is nonnegative

Solution
Or: For any real number $r,r^2$ is nonnegative
Or: For any real number $r,r^2 \geq 0$
Or: For all real numbers $r, r^2 \geq 0$
