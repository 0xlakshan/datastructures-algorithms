#### Example 1.1.1 Writing Sentences Using Variables

Use variables to rewrite the following sentences more formally.

a. Are there numbers with the property that the sum of their squares equals the square of their sum ?

Solution
Are there numbers a and b with the property that $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2?$
Or: Are there numbers a and b such that $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2?$
Or: Do there exist any numbers a and b such that $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2?$

b. Given any real number, its square is nonnegative

Solution
Or: For any real number $r,r^2$ is nonnegative
Or: For any real number $r,r^2 \geq 0$
Or: For all real numbers $r, r^2 \geq 0$

#### Example 1.1.2 Rewriting a Universal Conditional Statement

For all real numbers $x$, if $x$ is nonzero then $x^2$ is positive
a. If a real number is nonzero, then its square is positive
b. For all nonzero real numbers $x^2$ is positive
c. if X is a nonzero real number then $x^2$ is positive
d. The square of any nonzero real number is positive.
e. All nonzero real numbers have positive squares (or: squares that are positive)
